# GameOfLife
This is a hobby project written in C++ using the SFML library, designed as a windowed application. It simulates Conway's Game of Life with added features, including a wrap-around map with no edges and basic optimization for smoother performance. This project showcases both SFML functionality and an interest in simulation design.
